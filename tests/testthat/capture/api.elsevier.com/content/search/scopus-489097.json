The research method uses a qualitative and quantitative approach with Design-Based Research. Data collection techniques use observation, documentation, and questionnaires. Qualitative data analysis uses data collection, data reduction, data presentation, and conclusions, and quantitative data analysis uses correlation regression. Research subjects are students, lecturers, and experts. The experimental results showed that implementation of social studies textbooks using Android-based AR technology is easy to visualize via cell phone. Based on expert validation, Social Studies textbooks are quite effective in Android-based AR technology. Research discussions provide evidence that the use of books is quite effective in fostering critical and creative thinking and building students' 21st-century skills. Research implications make it easier for students to visualize abstract material to become more concrete.",

Therefore, understanding the highly non-stational and complex impact of traffic factors on air quality is very important for building air quality prediction models. Using real-world air pollutant data from Taipei City, this study integrates diverse factors, including traffic flow, speed, rainfall patterns, and meteorological factors. We constructed a Bayesian network probability model based on rainfall events as a big data analysis framework to investigate understand traffic factor causality relationships and condition probabilities for meteorological factors and air pollutant concentrations. Generalized Additive Model (GAM) verified non-linear relationships between traffic factors and air pollutants. Consequently, we propose a long short term memory (LSTM) model to predict airborne pollutant concentrations. This study propose a new approach of air pollutants and meteorological variable analysis procedure by considering both rainfall amount and patterns. Results indicate improved air quality when controlling vehicle speed above 40 km/h and maintaining an average vehicle flow < 1200 vehicles per hour. This study also classified rainfall events into four types depending on its characteristic. Wet deposition from varied rainfall types significantly affects air quality, with TypeⅠrainfall events (long-duration heavy rain) having the most pronounced impact. An LSTM model incorporating GAM and Bayesian network outcomes yields excellent performance, achieving correlation R2 > 0.9 and 0.8 for first and second order air pollutants, i.e., CO, NO, NO2, and NOx; and O3, PM10, and PM2.5, respectively.",

To obtain clean and smooth data, Hanning is applied as one of the important components in smoothing. However, Hanning is not resistant to outliers. Therefore, this study aims to determine the best type of Hanning that is able to obtain the greatest performance of 4253HT smoother in signal recovery. Functions of Linear, Complex Sinusoidal, Custom Pulse Train, and Sawtooth signals corrupted with five levels of contaminated normal noise were used as signals in the smoothing process. All signals were applied to assess three different Hanning types, which were Tukey, Husain and Shitan. Besides, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as an evaluator to determine and assess the performance of 4253HT smoother when utilizing an alternative Hanning. Based on the overall performance of 4253HT smoother, Husain Hanning presented the best outcome and worked most efficiently at all levels of noise except at the lowest noise (10%), which Tukey Hanning executed better. The findings of this study could benefit other researchers to decide the best Hanning to be used before performing forecasting and further analysis to improve the accuracy of predicting.",

                "dc:description": "Basketball players normally use jump shots to score points during a game. The player must shoot the ball depending on their own experience that requires a long period of time to train. The player can learn faster and master the shooting skills with the assistance of video and data analysis. This paper determines the scoring effectiveness, the body posture and release angle of normal and fade–away jump shots in basketball using the biomechanics analysis. Recording devices were used to record the jump shots and the results were analysed by using several software including Wondershare Filmora, KMPlayer, Openpose, MATLAB, and Logger Pro. With the aid of biomechanics formula, MATLAB and Logger Pro software, the shooting angle, acceleration, energy, force, etc data were obtained. Results showed that the average angle of release that scored for both normal and fade-away jump shots were 59.4 and 59.5 degrees respectively. Normal jump shots had been concluded as more efficient due to 15 % higher scoring than the fade-away jump shots while they required 9.5 % less power to perform. Therefore, it was found that the improvement to the Openpose software can benefit many people. In potential future application, instead of detecting human posture, detecting objects might be a breakthrough for future application around the world.",

Moreover, this study employed the coordinate transformation and D-H method to model and analyze the forward and inverse kinematics of the ballet posture teaching model, and used the Monte Carlo method to verify the correctness of the exoskeleton motion space analysis. In addition, this study established a dynamic model, and used the Lagrangian equation method for a dynamic solution to obtain the relationship between the position, velocity and torque of each component. The data analysis indicated that the ballet posture teaching system, which is based on the scientific computing model and integrated with motion capture, can play an important role in ballet teaching.",

Primary source readings and discussion frameworks can tangibly link data analysis to questions of values within data science, computing ethics, or statistics courses. The particular cases of Sir Francis Galton and Sir Ronald Fisher—both statisticians and eugenicists—provide a rich collection of easily accessible digitized primary source material as well as a vast number of related popular and technical publications. Galton and Fisher figured centrally in the development of statistics as it is currently practiced (a substantial proportion of the technical content of introductory statistics courses were introduced by these men). However, the familiar tools of correlation and hypothesis testing were developed to analyze human data, often in service to the cause of eugenics. This article critically describes how we embedded problematic primary sources from Galton and Fisher into our courses and the discussions that ensued. We conclude with ideas for further implementations.",

Therefore, this study aims to achieve a digital interactive experience in theme park greening design through the use of entertainment robots and genetic algorithm optimization. The study analyzed the characteristics of experiential theme parks and introduced landscape 3D modeling techniques for creating interactive 3D models of green spaces in theme parks. By using technologies such as sensors and cameras, entertainment robots can perceive the presence and behavior of tourists. Entertainment robots can interact with tourists in real-time, customize them according to their interests and needs, and provide unique and enjoyable experiences for tourists. By collecting and analyzing feedback and behavioral data from tourists, the advantages and improvement points of digital interactive experiences can be identified. Through comparative experimental analysis with traditional experience methods, it was found that digital interactive experience can significantly improve tourist participation and satisfaction. Through user data analysis of interactive experience, this design can effectively improve the greening design of theme parks, enhance tourist participation and entertainment experience.",

By introducing interactive elements of games, recreational fitness robots can provide more interesting and challenging fitness experience, thus attracting more people to participate in sports training. Research and design and develop a game interactive entertainment fitness robot, with action recognition and user interaction functions, can perceive the user's actions and make corresponding responses. When the user interacts with the robot, the sensor continuously collects and records data, establishes a data acquisition and storage system, analyzes and processes the collected interactive data, identifies the user's movement pattern, assesses the user's physical fitness level, and identifies potential improvement points. According to the user's physical condition and training objectives, the appropriate exercise plan and game interaction mode are designed to provide better training results and entertainment experience. It is found that the game-based interactive entertainment fitness robot can effectively improve the user's exercise motivation and participation in sports training. Through the analysis of sports data, we can develop personalized training plans according to the specific needs and goals of users, so as to achieve better training results.",

Among different gameplay session analysis techniques, the collection of provenance data has stood out due to a crucial advantage of this approach: the possibility to identify cause–effect relationships between game events. In previous work, we presented our conceptual framework called Prov-Replay, which provides a replay synchronized with an interactive provenance graph visualization. We validate Prov-Replay by creating PinGU Replay, a tool that implements our conceptual framework and applied it in a commercial game. Due to the promising results, this paper extends our previous work by presenting a detailed overview about Prov-Replay implementation, introducing a new feature that provides an analysis dashboard, and applying our experiment methodology to a new commercial game. We also enhance the concept of analytics related to provenance through the replay pipeline. Finally, we made PinGU Replay available as open-source software. Our new experiment results reinforce that, when using our conceptual framework fundamentals, it is possible to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of qualitative analysis process.",

Interactive entertainment robots and artificial intelligence can effectively improve the user experience. At the same time, with the advancement of digitalization and networking in enterprise financial systems, the threat of network intrusion poses a serious threat to enterprise financial security. This article analyzes the simulation application of virtual robots and artificial intelligence based on deep learning in enterprise financial systems, and learns how to identify and distinguish between normal network traffic and malicious intrusion behavior. After completing the training of the model, it is deployed to the enterprise financial system to monitor network traffic in real time and perform intrusion detection. The model can analyze and judge the network traffic entering the system in real time, and detect possible network intrusion behaviors based on the learned patterns and features. This paper adopts deep learning algorithm and virtual robot technology to develop a virtual robot system based on deep learning, which can automatically execute financial simulation tasks and generate accurate and reliable financial statements and data analysis results by learning and simulating real enterprise financial data and business processes. By automating financial simulation tasks, virtual robots greatly improve the simulation efficiency and accuracy, and provide more valuable data support for enterprise decision-making. Through experimental testing, it has been found that the network intrusion detection method based on deep neural networks has high accuracy and reliability in enterprise financial systems.",

They have had remarkable success in areas that have significance for women, such as expanding Medicine and higher education, violence minimization, and empowering women to move from victims to leaders. The following are the long-term goals of a peaceful society. We are impressed by the dedication of these type of social entrepreneurs, especially the women who are trying to improve the development climate in India. As the start-up ecosystem in India expands, an increasing number of women across the country are launching game-changing social initiatives. These women seize control of major societal issues, driven by a strong desire to make others’ lives better. Every female entrepreneur wants to make a positive difference in the world, but their success varies. The degree of dedication and engagement varies based on the financial element, legal dimension, technical support, funding accessibility, entrepreneurial culture, and taxation and regulation. The objective of this study is to ascertain the function of social entrepreneurs in today’s society. The main objective of this research is to examine the impact of social entrepreneurship in facilitating sustainable development. Moreover, the presentation looks at social entrepreneurship as a means of addressing social problems, highlighting how analyzing social entrepreneurship might offer a resolution to enduring development obstacles. The study examines the present condition of social entrepreneurship, metrics of entrepreneurship, the foundations of entrepreneurship development, the corporate climate, entrepreneurial opportunities, and the feasibility of several social entrepreneurship business models. Surveys were disseminated to five distinct organizations with the purpose of gathering data. The SPSS data analysis method was utilized to examine the correlation between sustainable development and social entrepreneurship. In summary, social business models equip social entrepreneurs to actively engage in sustainable development.",

Because the discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) at fundamental frequencies of a second-order stationary random field are asymptotically uncorrelated (see Bandyopadhyay and Subba Rao, 2017), one can construct a stationarity test based on the sample covariance of the DFTs. Such a test is usually inferior because it involves an overestimated scale parameter that leads to low size and power. To circumvent this shortcoming, this paper proposes two self-normalized statistics based on extreme value and partial sum of the sample covariance of the DFTs. Under certain regularity conditions, it is shown that the proposed tests converge to functionals of Brownian motion. Simulations and a data analysis demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed tests.",

                "dc:description": "Purpose: The preoperative diagnosis of endometriosis associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) remains challenging for lack of effective diagnostic biomarker. We aimed to study clinical characteristics and develop a nomogram for diagnosing EAOC before surgery. Methods: A total of 87 patients with EAOC and 348 patients with ovarian endometrioma (OEM) were enrolled in our study. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and Logistic regression were utilized to select variables and construct the prediction model. The performance of the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and calibration plots, while decision curve analyses (DCAs) were conducted to assess clinical value. Bootstrap resampling was used to evaluated the stability of the model in the derivation set. Results: The EAOC patients were older compared to the OEM patients (46.41 ± 9.62 vs. 36.49 ± 8.09 year, P < 0.001) and proportion of postmenopausal women was higher in EAOC group than in the OEM group (34.5 vs. 1.5%, P < 0.001). Our prediction model, which included age at diagnosis, tumor size, cancer antigen (CA) 19–9 and risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA), demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.858 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.795–0.920) in the derivation set (N = 304) and an AUC of 0.870 (95% CI: 0.779–0.961) in the validation set (N = 131). The model fitted both the derivation (Hosmer–Lemeshow test (HL) chi-square = 12.600, P = 0.247) and the validation (HL chi-square = 8.210, P = 0.608) sets well. Conclusion: Compared to patients with OEM, those with EAOC exhibited distinct clinical characteristics. Our four-variable prediction model demonstrated excellent performance in both the derivation and validation sets, suggesting its potential to assist with preoperative diagnosis of EAOC.",

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is one of the most fatal cancers in the world. However, the biological function of NUDT21 in PAAD remains rarely understood. The aim of this research was to identify the prediction value of NUDT21 in diagnosis, prognosis, immune infiltration, and signal pathway in PAAD. Methods: Combined with the data in online databases, we analyzed the expression, immune infiltration, function enrichment, signal pathway, diagnosis, and prognosis of NUDT21 in PAAD. Then, the biological function of NUDT21 and its interacted protein in PAAD was identified through plasmid transduction system and protein mass spectrometry. Expression of NUDT21 was further verified in clinical specimens by immunofluorescence. Results: We found that NUDT21 was upregulated in PAAD tissues and was significantly associated with the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer through bioinformatic data analysis. We also found that overexpression of NUDT21 enhanced PAAD cells proliferation and migration, whereas knockdown NUDT21 restored the effects through in vitro experiment. Moreover, NDUFS2 was recognized as a potential target of NUDT21.We further verified that the expression of NDUFS2 was positively correlated with NUDT21 in PAAD clinical specimens. Mechanically, we found that NUDT21 stabilizes NDUFS2 and activates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our investigation reveals that NUDT21 is a previously unrecognized oncogenic factor in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment target of PAAD, and we suggest that NUDT21 might be a novel therapeutic target in PAAD.",

During the COVID - 19 pandemic and limitations of face-to-face education, the use of distance education can play an important role in providing education to patients. The aim of this study is the effect of model 5A self-management training on medication adherence in epileptic patients. METHODS: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 56 epileptic patients referred to Shiraz Namazi Hospital were divided into intervention and control groups using random allocation. Thereafter, 5A self - management training sessions were virtually held in 5 sessions in WhatsApp application for intervention group. The data collection tool was MMAS-8 at two stages of before and two months after intervention. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 21 software. RESULTS: The results of Wilcoxon test showed that in intervention group, the mean drug adherence in patients after intervention significantly increased compared to before intervention (p = 0.005). But in control group, this was not significant (p = 0.909). According to results of Mann-Whitney test, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups before intervention (p = 0.632). However, by passing two months from intervention, a significant difference was found between intervention and control groups (p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Based on results, the implementation of model 5A can be effective on medication adherence in epileptic patients. This program can be considered as a suitable method in epileptic patients during COVID - 19 pandemic.",

Since stress, anxiety and depression are effective in various dimensions of chronic diseases management and considering that health literacy plays a decisive role in the quality of life of these patients. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of determining the association between health literacy and stress, anxiety and depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current research is a cross-sectional analytical study that was conducted with the participation of 164 patient's from the MS society of Jahrom city with convenience sampling. The data collection tool was the health literacy questionnaire of multiple sclerosis patients and a 21-question stress, anxiety and depression questionnaire. SPSS - 21 software, descriptive statistics and spearman and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The findings showed that the majority of patients had a borderline health literacy (53.7%). 43.3% of patients had adequate level of health literacy. Also, the findings showed that the stress, anxiety and depression levels of the majority of patients were moderate. Spearman's test showed that there is a negative and significant correlation between health literacy and stress in multiple sclerosis patients (p=0.03) (r=-0.37). While there was no significant correlation between health literacy and anxiety and depression of patients. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that with the increase in the health literacy, the rate of stress in patient's decreases.",

In this process of territorial occupation, constructions on soft clay soils represent significant structural hazards. This study aimed to evaluate structural instabilities in a public school in Florianópolis (SC, Brazil), using integrated geology, geotechnics, and geophysics data. This is a case study in an area characterized by the urbanization process of the West Side of the Costeira do Pirajubaé Massif. Geologically, the study area is composed of granitic rocks, soft clay deposits, and colluvial soils, in an environment of the upper third to the middle of the slope. For data analysis, geophysical, geotechnical, and geological methods were used. In the results, it was identified upstream colluvium, evidenced by the wide variety of soils (sandy, yellowish silt clay, of medium consistency), as well as gray clay deposits, ranging from very soft to hard, with distinct characteristics of the residual soils of the granitoid downstream, which are normally medium consistency brown to yellowish clays, expected for the B horizon. The results indicate a potential slip surface, which corresponds to a layer of soft clay deposits. Thus, it can be concluded that the observed instabilities, characterized by footing displacement, cracks, and subsidence demonstrate subsoil fragilities related to human interventions and the insufficiency of the drainage system, even when existing.",

The classical Greenwood statistic, extensively examined in the existing literature, has found diverse and interesting applications across various domains. Furthermore, numerous modifications to the classical statistic have been proposed. The modified Greenwood statistic, as proposed and discussed in this paper, shares several key properties with its classical counterpart. Emphasizing its stochastic monotonicity within three broad classes of distributions – namely, generalized Pareto, α−stable, and Student's t distributions – we advocate for the utilization of the modified Greenwood statistic in testing scenarios. Our exploration encompasses three distinct directions. In the first direction, we employ the modified Greenwood statistic for Gaussian distribution testing. Our empirical results compellingly illustrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms alternative goodness-of-fit tests documented in the literature, particularly exhibiting superior efficacy for small sample sizes. The second considered problem involves testing whether the distribution of a random sample has infinite variance. The last proposition suggests using the modified Greenwood statistic for testing of a given distribution. The presented simulation study strongly supports the efficiency of the proposed approach in the considered problems. Theoretical results and power simulation studies are further validated by real data analysis.",

Methods: The two-day program including tailored medical information, peer consultation and psychological support aimed to improve diagnosis-specific knowledge and empowerment. Post-training satisfaction was measured using an adapted ZUF-8 questionnaire, scoring from 5 (worst) to a maximum of 26 (best) for persons aged 6–17 and from 10 to 40 points for adults, including 2 open-ended questions. Results: The questionnaire, completed by 89 children (6–13 years), 92 adolescents (14–17 years), 47 young adults (18–24 years), and 345 parents, revealed consistent high satisfaction with the program regardless of age or diagnosis (children 24.4 ± 2.1, adolescents 23.5 ± 2.7; young adults 36.0 ± 4.0, parents 36.6 ± 3.4). Neither sociodemographic factors nor diagnosis burden, shame, or informedness showed relevant associations with satisfaction levels. Participants highlighted exchange and open atmosphere as key satisfaction elements. Conclusion: Satisfaction with the new education program was high in all examined groups. Implementing it in routine care requires further analysis to determine the program's long-term effects on well-being and knowledge. Innovation: The first educational program for young people with DSD addressing their specific challenges through inclusive language, an open approach to sex and gender and the inclusion of self-help groups.",

It was qualitative, exploratory-descriptive research carried out with twenty-nine members of the residency program in obstetric nursing private in a higher education institution in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul. Data were collected through an online questionnaire from March to July 2021 and interpreted by content analysis. The following categories emerged from the data analysis: Contribution of training to the current scenario of maternal and child health; Difficulties and challenges: the confrontations of training; and from the training received to the expected training. It was revealed that all graduates were female, being few with previous experience when entering the residency program and, after completion, most continued to work in various spaces of maternal and child and obstetric care.",

In this paper, we introduce RadioGalaxyNET, a multimodal dataset, and a suite of novel computer vision algorithms designed to automate the detection and localization of multi-component extended radio galaxies and their corresponding infrared hosts. The dataset comprises 4 155 instances of galaxies in 2 800 images with both radio and infrared channels. Each instance provides information about the extended radio galaxy class, its corresponding bounding box encompassing all components, the pixel-level segmentation mask, and the keypoint position of its corresponding infrared host galaxy. RadioGalaxyNET is the first dataset to include images from the highly sensitive Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope, corresponding infrared images, and instance-level annotations for galaxy detection. We benchmark several object detection algorithms on the dataset and propose a novel multimodal approach to simultaneously detect radio galaxies and the positions of infrared hosts.",

                "dc:description": "Wind power is a clean and renewable source of energy that plays a crucial role in the global effort to combat climate change. Yet, the effects of offshore wind farms on the marine environment remain poorly understood and there is a lack of field data analysis in this area. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting a year-long examination of water quality and phytoplankton communities around the Guishan offshore wind farm (GS-OWF) in the Lingdingyang Bay, Pearl River Estuary, China. The analysis of water quality indicators reveals repelling effect on algae dispersion but no significant contamination resulting from the running of the wind farm over the course of one year. These indicators encompassed various parameters, such as water depth (4.1 − 17.4 m), salinity (16.9 – 28.4 ‰), pH (7.41 – 8.35), temperature (20.5 − 31.2 °C), transparency (⁓ 1.5 m), dissolved oxygen (⁓ 7.5 mg L−1), chemical oxygen demand (⁓ 0.81 mg L−1), chlorophyll-a (14.7 − 0.139 μg L−1), petroleum (0 – 0.0527 mg L−1), and various heavy metals. The cell composition (4 phyla, 158 species, dominated by Bacillariophyta) and density (3 – 1809 cells m−3) demonstrate a healthy phytoplankton community. These results indicate a benign estuary environment after the construction of GS-OWF. This study provides valuable insights into the environmental effects of offshore wind farms, principles for site selection, and the integration of aquaculture convergence with offshore wind farms.",

The goal of this paper is to accelerate the transition of new methods into practice by improving the C&T researcher's ability to gain confidence in interpreting and implementing Bayesian analyses. Methods: We developed a Bayesian data analysis plan and implemented that plan for a two-arm clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of a new opioid in reducing time to discharge from the post-operative anesthesia unit and nerve block usage in surgery. Through this application, we offer a brief tutorial on Bayesian methods and exhibit how to apply four Bayesian statistical packages from STATA, SAS, and RStan to conduct linear and logistic regression analyses in clinical research. Results: The analysis results in our application were robust to statistical package and consistent across a wide range of prior distributions. STATA was the most approachable package for linear regression but was more limited in the models that could be fitted and easily summarized. SAS and R offered more straightforward documentation and data management for the posteriors. They also offered direct programming of the likelihood making them more easily extendable to complex problems. Conclusion: Bayesian analysis is now accessible to a broad range of data analysts and should be considered in more C&T research analyses. This will allow C&T research teams the ability to adopt and interpret Bayesian methodology in more complex problems where Bayesian approaches are often needed.",

Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at the Indus Hospital and Health Network. Data from 1st January, 2020 to 31st December, 2021 was analyzed. A total of 1499 EPTB specimens were included for which GeneXpert was requested along with acid-fast bacteria (AFB) culture from the same specimen. Specimens were processed according to specimen type following standard operating procedures of the laboratory. Fluorescent staining was performed on all specimens along with bacteriologic culture. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay was carried out in exact accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Results: Out of 1499 EPTB specimens, 1370 (91.39%) specimens exhibited concordance between GeneXpert and conventional culture method, while 129 (8.60%) specimens showed discordance. GeneXpert exhibited sensitivity and specificity of 69.4% and 94.3% respectively in comparison to culture. Conclusion: GeneXpert sensitivity for the diagnosis of EPTB varied with the site involved. Lower sensitivity was observed in ascitic and pleural fluids as compared to higher sensitivity observed among urine samples and pus aspirates. However, given the quick turnaround time and ease of use, it is a helpful tool in the diagnosis of EPTB when utilized in the appropriate clinical context. Caution is advised while interpreting negative GeneXpert results in endemic settings and should be interpreted along with other supporting clinical and diagnostic features.",
