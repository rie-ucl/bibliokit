\title{Topic-Based Country Network Analysis}
\usage{
topic_country_network(res)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A list containing Scopus search results with an \code{entries} element,
where each entry contains \code{authkeywords} (keywords separated by '|'),
\code{dc:description} (abstract), and \code{affiliation} (containing \code{affiliation-country}).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggraph} object that visualizes the network of topics and countries.
The plot includes nodes representing topics and countries, with edges showing
the connections between them. Nodes are color-coded by their type (topics or countries),
and edge thickness is proportional to the number of shared keywords between topics and countries.
The color of the edges is determined by the frequency of connections, with a gradient
from light blue (low frequency) to dark blue (high frequency).
}
\description{
This function performs a network analysis based on topics (keywords) and countries
from the given publication data. It visualizes the relationship between different
topics and the countries associated with those topics.
