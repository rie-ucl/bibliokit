# BiblioKit

This package offers tools for analyzing and visualizing bibliometric data from academic literature. It includes functions for extracting and processing citation data, generating keyword co-occurrence networks, and producing authorand publication statistics. The package aims to assist researchers in exploring trends and patterns in scientific publications.

### **Functions**
| Name | Overview | 
| --- | --- | 
| Download Scopus Data | The download_scopus_data() function retrieves bibliographic records from the Scopus API for the past N years. |
| Expand Search Terms | The `expand_search_terms()` function takes one or more initial search terms and returns a query (expanded set of terms) by including related or similar terms. The expansion helps to capture more relevant results by broadening the search. |
| Get Search Query | This function extracts the search query string from a URL containing Scopus API search parameters. |
| Get Search Terms | This function extracts search keywords and other query parameters from the provided Scopus search URL within the `res` object. The URL is obtained from `res$get_statements$url`. |
| Have Api Key | To use the Bibliokit library, you need a Scopus API account. If you have not set up your API key yet, you need to sign up your Scopus API account and set it up for your device. Follow the instruction of `rscopus` library. By using have_apr_key() function (a simple wrapper of the same-name function of `rscopus` library), you can check if you already have a proper API key. |
| Plot Authnum Trend | The `plot_authnum_trend()` function analyses and visualizes the annual publication trends for the number of authors from Scopus search results. You can specify `type` of the output from `line`, `stack` and `ratio`. |
| Plot Country Overview | The `plot_country_overview()` function analyses and visualise the countries associated with publications from Scopus search results. |
| Plot Country Pairs Collaboration Ratio | The `plot_country_pairs_collaboration_ratio()` function analyses and visualizes the annual publication trends for country pairs with their collaboration ratio from Scopus search results. You can filter the result with a target country by specifying `target_country` and choose the `type` of the output from `line` or `stack`. |
| Plot Country Pairs Trend | The `plot_country_pairs_trend()` function analyses and visualizes the annual publication trends for country pairs from Scopus search results. You can filter the result with a target country by specifying `target_country`. |
| Plot Country Trend | The `plot_country_trend()` function analyses and visualizes the annual publication trends for countries from Scopus search results. |
| Plot Sponsor Overview | The `plot_sponsor_overview()` function analyses and visualise the sponsors from Scopus search results.. |
| Plot Sponsor Trend | The `plot_sponsor_trend()` function analyses and visualizes the annual publication trends for sponsors from Scopus search results. |
| Rank Affiliations | The `rank_affiliations()` function generates a ranking of the top affiliations from the provided Scopus search results, based on the number of publications and total citations. By choosing the `type = "city"` or `type = "institution"` option, the function can provide the ranking of cities or institutions instead of countries. The output is a tibble with the following columns: `rank` rank of the affiliation, `country/city/institution` type of the affiliation, and `n` number of publications. |
| Rank Authors | The `rank_authors()` function generates a ranking of the top authors from the provided Scopus search results, based on the number of publications and total citations. By setting the `include_all = TRUE` option, the function can include not only the first authors but also all authors of the publications in the ranking. The output is a tibble with the following columns: `rank` rank of the author, `name` author's name, `n_publications` number of publications, `n_citations` total number of citations, `institution` author's primary institution, and `country` author's country. |
| Rank Keywords | The `rank_keywords()` function generates a ranking of the top keywords from the provided Scopus search results, based on the number of publications and total citations. By setting the `abst = TRUE` option, the function can include not only the keywords tagged by the authors but also the abstracts of the papers in the ranking. The output is a tibble with the following columns: `rank` rank of the keyword, `keyword` the keyword, and `n` number of publications with the keyword. |
| Rank Sponsors | The `rank_sponsors()` function generates a ranking of the top sponsors from the provided Scopus search results, based on the number of publications and total citations. The output is a tibble with the following columns: `rank` rank of the sponsor, `sponsor` sponsor's name with abbreviation, `n_publications` number of publications, `n_citations` total number of citations, `cite_per_pub` average number of citations per publication, `countries_display` comma-separated list of countries where the sponsor is active, and `countries` list of countries where the sponsor is active. |
| Sna Countries | The `sna_countries()` function analyses co-occurrence data between countries based on shared keywords and creates a network graph visualizing the relationships between countries. The network is constructed based on the frequency of shared keywords between countries. The resulting graph can help in understanding how countries are connected through common research topics. |
| Sna Topic Country | The `sna_topic_country()` function analyses a network analysis based on topics (keywords) and countries from the given publication data. It visualizes the relationship between different topics and the countries associated with those topics. |
